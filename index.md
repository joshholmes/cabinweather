# Cabin Weather

Cabin Weather is a little project built at an Intel Iot Roadshow using the Edison board. It uses the Weather Underground API to pull what weather is coming and uses local sensors to see what's happening outside right now. 

### Main Hub 

This is the center device that collects from Weather Underground using the Mashery APIs. 

### Remote Sensors 

This is the module that pulls data from the local sensors and pushes it to the central hub.
